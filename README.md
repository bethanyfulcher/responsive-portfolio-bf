# Responsive-Portfolio

## README

## Introduction:
This web application is a multi-page portfolio for Bethany Fulcher.

## Links:
It displays three different HTML pages that are all linked in a navigation bar at the top of each screen. 

The 'About' tab is the home page where you can read a little about Bethany. 

You can find Bethany's contacts on the 'Contact' page. You can also send your name, email, and a message to the creator (not functional).

The 'Portfolio' section should feature images of Bethany's work but is currently being replaced by placeholder images of dogs.
